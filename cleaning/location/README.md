## Artist Location Cleaning

The script to generate this statistics and graph is location.py, which is found in
this same folder.

### Basic statistics for the Artist Location field:

There are **487129 null values** of the 1 million songs (almost half).

Obtaining the artist location is difficult because there is no standard format, some examples of location that we can find are:

Some artist_location values | Format
--------------------------- | ------
Chicago, IL  | City < comma > State_Abbreviation    (Country = USA)
New Jersey  | State   (Country = USA)
Sassuolo, Italy  | City < comma > Country
CANADA - Ontario | Country < hyphen > State
Queens, NY  | Borough < comma >  State_Abbreviation
Burlington, Ontario, Canada  | City < comma >  State < comma >  Country
CP3  | (Invalid location)
UK - England - London  | State_Abbreviation < hyphen > Country < hyphen > City
Tokyo/Japan  | City < slash > Country
Jerez De La Frontera (CÃ¡diz) | City < open_parenthesis > City (Spanish) < close_parenthesis >

The cleaning process was divided in three steps:
1. It was generated a new file: location_result.txt with the artist_id, state, and country.
In order to determine state and country values was used the artist_location column of the original
MSD. For this step were used lists of the countries of the world and the states of USA.   
2. The duplicated rows were eliminated
3. Some statistics were generated

This cleaning process can be extended and improved to cover a bigger number of artists
and songs when considering more cases of identification of countries and states.
